      <title>Convolutional Neural Network Bird Detector</title>

      <description>Now live at isitabird.mckeogh.tech EDIT: Also now written entirely in Go!
It’s been done many times already, but I needed a project to distract from my looming exam results. Like many others, I saw xkcd No. 1425 as a challenge, and in a few hours I had a working bird classifier, written in Python. New code available on GitHub.
There are many much better written articles online describing how it works, but essentially small mathematical functions, like neurones in a brain, make up networks that will take an input, apply those functions to it and produce an output.</description>

      <title>Computer Vision for UAS Search and Rescue</title>

      <description>I am currently developing a multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to be used in search and rescue operations using object recognition to find a target and deliver a payload, e.g. to help an injured climber on traditionally inaccessible terrain needing to be dropped fluids, a torch, an insulating blanket and/or a flare to assist their survival and later rescue.
The onboard computer is a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Navio2 board.</description>

      <title>RGB Motion Reactive Bluetooth Snowboard</title>

      <description>The weekend before we left on a winter holiday, I saw a bluetooth module and an Pro Mini on a breadboard and had an idea. What if I could control the lighting on a snowboard with my phone? 4 hours later, an LED strip and 5V regulator ordered, I set out to create a lighting system that I could install onto my board. Since I would be renting one and I couldn’t take any tools on the plane I had to plan carefully.</description>

      <title>Long Range UAS</title>

      <description>My latest build is a Pixhawk Skywalker 1900 UAV. It has a wingspan of 1.9m, and uses a 4s 16000mAh battery.
The plane is outfitted with a 1.3GHz 800mW video transmitter, minimOSD and Skew Planer antenna.
My current record is a 3h14m flight completely autonomous, from take off to landing. I have been able to fly at 350M AGL drawing only 3.4 amps, showing at least 4 hours is possible on this platform with further work.</description>

      <description>I was a student ambassador for the Aberystwyth University robotics department in 2014 and again in 2015. I demonstrated and talked to the public about the work I had done in the Aberystwyth Robotics Club.

      <title>First Quadcopter</title>

      <description>Recently, I found an old YouTube account of mine and along with it, this video. I made it aged 13 using my first quadcopter, a HobbyKing KK2.0 “mini quad”. I believe a member of the model club I attended had given me their old 72MHz radio and receiver which I used to fly this drone in the video.
Please excuse the cheesy music.
 There is also a video of a few first person video components I made, and please excuse my voice/sentence structure/accent.</description>
