Recently, I found an old YouTube account of mine and along with it, this video. I made it aged 13 using my first quadcopter, a HobbyKing KK2.0 “mini quad”. I believe a member of the model club I attended had given me their old 72MHz radio and receiver which I used to fly this drone in the video.

Please excuse the cheesy music.

There is also a video of a few first person video components I made, and please excuse my voice/sentence structure/accent, I was 13.
